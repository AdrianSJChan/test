	<h1><b>HTML/CSS</b></h1>
	<p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and its the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure and content of the page. Moreover, CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets is reponsible for the desgin and 'look' of the webpage. it is able to change settings such as font type and colour of page. </p>

	<h2>HTML Example</h2>
	<img src="htmleg.png">
	<p>Above is an image of my index page this shows the basic structure of html. As you can see structing html is like arranging boxes and putting the correct contents into the right boxes. For example, for "Who am I" I typed in my content about myself and arranged it a way that can be easily identified</p>

	

	<h3>CSS Example</h3>
	<img src="csseg.png">
	<p>Above is an image of my css code, this shows how css can be used to cassify the look and design of each designated 'box' this allows multiple html text to be designed similarly. This allows easier web designing.</p>
